# Neural Question Generation
This is my work on neural question generation.

This is a tensorflow implementation on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00106).

I will further update the repository as I continue my work. See [this](https://res.qyzhou.me) for help.

##### Simple GRU file

A Simple implementation of GRU cell for training on random data using Adam Optimizer

#### Incomplete

model.py file is in works. To complete decoder_module function first as per the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00106).
